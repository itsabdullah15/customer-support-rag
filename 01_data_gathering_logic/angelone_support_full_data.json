Trading & Surveillance Trading & Surveillance Risk Management – ASM & GSM What is a surveillance measure? Market surveillance plays a key role in ensuring safety and integrity of the markets as it the process of prevention and investigation of abusive, manipulative or illegal trading practices in the securities markets. Surveillance Measure is an initative by the regulatory bodies and exchanges to protect traders and investors by monitoring price and volatility and detecting misleading activities like insider trading, fictitious transactions, and more. What is ASM? SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India) along with the stock exchanges have initiated an Additional Surveillance Measure or ASM to safeguard investors’ interests by ensuring there are no market speculations or manipulations like unexpected price movements. The stocks are categorized under ASM for surveillance based on criteria specified by NSE here . What is GSM? GSM or Graded Surveillance Measure is a system used by Indian Stock Exchanges like NSE and BSE to alert traders/investors and ask them to be extra cautious while dealing in certain securities which have been categorized under GSM. Scrips can be classified under GSM due to abnormal price hike that doesn’t match with the company’s financial health, are illiquid, have negligible market capital, and are underpreforming. What is the difference between ASM and GSM? The main aim of the ASM framework is to control stock volatility, while the primary objective of GSM is to protect the investors from underperforming stocks by not allowing intraday trading and to advise them to be extra vigilant while dealing with securities that are witnessing unusual price fluctuations. Both these frameworks are introduced with different objectives, but their main goal is to protect traders and investors. What is the basis of categorizing a scrip under ASM? SEBI and Exchanges jointly decides the objective criterion to shortlist securities under ASM based on the following parameters: 1. High Low Variation 2. Client Concentration 3. Close to Close Price Variation 4. Market Capitalization 5. Volume Variation 6. Delivery Percentage 7. No. of Unique PANs & PEs When will a scrip be classified under GSM? On the basis of below-mentioned pointers, Regulatory Body and the Exchanges make their decision of adding a scrip under GSM category: 1. Periodic Call Auction Session for Illiquid Securities 2. Periodic Review of Movement of Securities to/from Trade for Trade 3. Persistent Noise Creators 4. Rumour Verification and Clarification in case of Spurt in Price/Volume When will a scrip get out of ASM/GSM? Every 2 months in the case of ASM and every quarter in the case of GSM, the stock can go in and out of the list based on the review carried out by the exchange.

Verifying your mobile number helps us create a secure account for you, ensuring a smooth app experience and the safety of your account. Can I continue if the mobile number linked to my bank is different from the one registered with the app? No, your details, including your mobile number, must match those verified by our banking partner. A mismatch will result in your application being rejected by the bank. Why are permissions to send SMS and access phone state required? These permissions are needed to verify your mobile number by sending an SMS. Rest assured, these permissions are used solely for verification purposes. Can I link any SIM for FD purchase if I have a dual SIM phone? Yes, you can. However, we recommend using the SIM registered with your bank account for authentication. Can I retry the registration if it was not successful earlier? Yes, you can retry. Ensure you use the SIM linked to your bank account for authentication. Can I invest in FD if I do not have a PAN? No, currently, we only process fixed deposit requests for individuals with an active PAN. Why is my PAN not getting verified? For booking fixed deposits, we need to verify your PAN with the regulated authorities. If there is a mismatch, the booking cannot be completed. What should I do if the name shown against my PAN is incorrect and I can't update it? The name linked to your PAN should be accurate for successful identity verification and KYC purposes. Please update your name to match your PAN. Why is my Aadhar required? Aadhar is mandatory for identification and KYC setup for your account, necessary for processing your FD request. Do I need a physical copy of my Aadhar? No, a physical copy is not required. We use secure platforms like DigiLocker and CKYC for verifying your Aadhar and other documents. What is DigiLocker? DigiLocker is a government initiative under the Digital India project for storing and verifying documents like PAN card, driving license, Aadhar card, school marksheets, and insurance papers. What should I do if there's a name mismatch and I can't complete the step? For successful FD booking, the name on your Aadhar and PAN should match. Correct the details on either your PAN or Aadhar card and retry. How can I add a new address as my current address? Use the “add” button on the address choice screen to add an address that is not listed. What should I do if I can't change my permanent address? The address from your Aadhar is considered your permanent address. You may add or select your current address to proceed with the FD application. Can my permanent address be the same as my current address? Yes, you can select your permanent address as your current address if they are the same. Why is video KYC required? Video KYC is required to complete the KYC verification step as mandated by the RBI. What if I am not available during bank working hours? If you have made the payment, we will notify you when the bank officers are available. If video KYC is not completed within 3 days, your money will be refunded to your bank account. When can I complete the Video KYC? Video KYC is available from Monday to Saturday, 09:00 AM to 08:00 PM. We will notify you to complete the video KYC during these hours if pending. What if video KYC fails? You can retry during banking hours within 2 days of FD booking if your video KYC fails. How will I know the status of my video KYC? Your video KYC details are verified by bank officers, which may take up to 3 hours. Track the video KYC and FD confirmation status on the ‘My Investments’ tab. What should I do if I can't move to the next step and complete my KYC verification? Retry using the correct details. If it still doesn’t work, try again later. If the issue persists, raise a ticket with our support team for assistance. Why are details related to occupation, income, and family required for FD booking? These details are required by the bank to create your fixed deposit and ensure communication if needed. Why is my money deducted before video KYC? Your money is deducted before video KYC as it is the last step to verify your identity and book your FD. Your money is safe with the bank, and interest starts accumulating from the time of payment. In case of issues with VKYC, your money will be refunded within 7 working days. What is required for completing a video KYC? Keep your PAN Card and a blank paper with a pen ready for the VKYC process. Still need help? Create Ticket Want to connect with us?

Why am I unable to apply for IPOs via my UPI ID/Handle? For IPO applications, only UPI ID/Handles approved by NPCI are allowed. In case you are unable to apply for IPO using your UPI ID/Handle, we recommend that you check the list of banks/apps approved by NPCI for providing UPI service for IPO application. Why can’t I see my UPI handle listed in the dropdown in the Angel One app while applying for an IPO? In case you can’t find your UPI Handle in the dropdown list on the IPO page in the Angel One app, it means your UPI Handle is not approved by NPCI for applying for an IPO. Try to use or create an alternative UPI ID with any of the entities featured on the NPCI list. When will I receive my UPI mandate request after placing an order? Below are a few things you can do: Go to your Payment App – Navigate to the mandate section and check if you have an open mandate or not. In case you have received many mandates then you can cross verify with the Application ID mentioned in the mandate details with the Application ID mentioned in the order details from Angel One’s Application OR Make sure your Payments App is updated. OR If it is taking longer than 6 hours then cancel your bid from Angel one’s application and place a new bid. How to approve an IPO mandate request? You have to approve the IPO mandate request in your UPI app. By when can I approve the UPI mandate request? Pending mandates shall expire after 5 PM on the last day. So users should accept the mandate before 5 PM on the last day to participate in the IPO. What are the charges of applying for an IPO? With Angel One, there are no charges to apply for an IPO. How can an NRI apply for an IPO using the Angel One app? NRI’s can not apply via the Angel One app. However, they can apply through the physical ASBA (Application Supported By Blocked Amount) process with your bank. What is the cut-off price & why should I apply at a cut-off price? Cut-off price is the price at which the shares get issued through an IPO to the investors. This price is ascertained at the allotment stage. When an investor applies for an IPO at a cut-off price, that means he is ready to bid at this price. In an ideal scenario, all retail investors bid at the cut-off price to increase their chance of allotment. Can I use a bank account not linked with Angel One to apply? You can apply for an IPO using any other bank account provided the account is in the name of the investor. Can I apply for an IPO using my bank’s current account? It is preferred that you apply using your savings account as most banks do not process IPO applications submitted using a current account. You need to check with your bank for more details. Can I apply for an IPO using my HUF’s account? You cannot apply via the Angel One app. However, you can apply using your HUF account through the physical ASBA process with your bank. My daughter is a minor. Can I apply for an IPO using her account? The Angel One app doesn’t allow a minor to apply. Although, a minor can apply via physical ASBA process through your bank. Why didn’t my account get debited after applying for an IPO? As per the ASBA process, banks will simply hold/block your money when you apply for an IPO. Once the shares are allotted to you, the amount will be debited from your bank account. If the shares are not allotted to you, the amount will be unblocked/released to your account on/before the UPI mandate expiry date. Note: Banks usually take 10-15 days to release your funds. If your funds are still blocked after 15 days please contact your bank . Can I modify my IPO bid? Yes, you can modify the lot size and UPI ID of your IPO bid after placing an order. Please note that if you have approved your UPI mandate request for the order and modified the order later, the entire IPO bid amount will be blocked in addition to the amount blocked for your original IPO bid. You will also receive another UPI mandate request for your modified bid. However, if you haven’t approved the original mandate request, no amount will be blocked for the original IPO bid. Why is my IPO application rejected? Few of the common reasons your IPO application is rejected You might have entered the wrong UPI ID or UPI PIN while approving the mandate Ensuring that the Bank A/c, Demat A/c, and UPI ID are mapped to the same PAN For example: Jack is using Jill’s UPI ID to apply for an IPO with his Demat A/c. In such a case, Jack’s application will be rejected because Jill’s bank account used is not linked to the demat account of Jack Jill’s UPI ID used is not linked to Jack’s PAN When will my funds be blocked and unblocked? Your funds will be blocked once you approve the UPI mandate request for IPO. Your funds will be unblocked/released on or before the UPI mandate expiry date if the shares are not allotted through IPO. Please reach out to your bank in case funds are not unblocked/released post the mandate expiry date. How can I get a guaranteed IPO allotment? We would like to explain that Angel One is merely a platform to apply for IPO and has no control over its allotment. IPO allotment can never be guaranteed since, in case of over-subscription, the allotment is done via a lottery system. However, you can avoid application rejection by Applying from only 1 Demat account per PAN Applying at cut-off price Ensuring that the Bank A/c, Demat A/c, and UPI ID are mapped to the same PAN For example: Jack is using Jill’s UPI ID to apply for an IPO with his Demat A/c. In such a case, Jack’s application will be rejected because Jill’s bank A/C used is not linked to the Demat A/c of Jack Jill’s UPI ID used is not linked to Jack’s PAN Where can I check my refund status in case of a rejected/non-allotted IPO application? Banks will simply hold/block your money when you apply for an IPO. So, your funds will be released/unblocked on or before the UPI mandate expiry date. Please reach out to your bank in case funds are not unblocked or released post the mentioned date. Why didn’t I get my IPO allotment? Common reasons why you didn’t get the allotment are Non-Allotment – Allotment is done through lottery system because of over-subscription Rejection – Application can be rejected due to either of the following reasons: 1) Application received from multiple Demat accounts having the same PAN 2) Bank account Demat account, and UPI ID used for an application not mapped to the same PAN 3) Your bid price is lower than the final issue price Is tax applicable on profit from an IPO? Tax will be levied on your profit as per your tax bracket. When is the next IPO coming? Visit our website https://www.angelone.in/upcoming-IPO to get all information about forthcoming IPO’s.

Presently, we do not have the feature to facilitate the change of the bank account used to set up the EMI mandate. We urge you to continue servicing your EMI through the bank account that was used at the time of loan disbursement. When can I foreclose my loan?

Here it is the next business day. Payments made via UPI mode generally result in same-day NAV if the order is placed before cut-off. This happens because settlement to ICCL happens generally happens before cut-off if made via UPI. Angel One depends on payment aggregator for ICCL settlements. Payments made via Netbanking generally result in next working day’s NAV. This happens as settlement to ICCL does not happen real time and generally takes places on ‘T+1’ basis.

I got less money than what I placed an withdrawal order for? Your withdraw amount is converted to corresponding units while placing order at exchange. We calculate the units to be withdrawn based on current NAVs. Mutual fund NAVs (Net Asset Value) are updated every day after the market closes from Monday to Friday (All working days) For example, on June 3rd, you will see the NAV for June 2nd. Consider the following scenario for withdraw order placed on June 3rd: If NAV on 3rd June > 2nd June, You will receive an amount greater than order amount. If NAV on 3rd June < 2nd June, You will receive an amount lesser than order amount. In Summary, you will receive an amount according to latest NAV. Will my next instalment be auto-debited? Your next SIP instalment will be Auto-Debited from your bank account if you have a valid Auto-pay setup. If not please setup an Autopay so that your future SIP instalments can be automated. To setup an Autopay, Please click below: {Setup Autopay} What is Stamp duty? The government collects 0.005% of the overall purchase amount of any mutual fund scheme as stamp duty. So even if entire amount is debited from your bank account, 0.005 percent of total amount is deducted and hence when order is completed, Same is reflected as invested amount. Still need help?
