  "No, your details, including your mobile number, must match those verified by our banking partner.

However, we recommend using the SIM registered with your bank account for authentication.\nCan I retry the registration if it was not successful earlier?\nYes, you can retry. Ensure you use the SIM linked to your bank account for authentication.\nCan I invest in FD if I do not have a PAN?",
  "Can I invest in FD if I do not have a PAN?\nNo, currently, we only process fixed deposit requests for individuals with an active PAN.\nWhy is my PAN not getting verified?\nFor booking fixed deposits, we need to verify your PAN with the regulated authorities. If there is a mismatch, the booking cannot be completed.\nWhat should I do if the name shown against my PAN is incorrect and I can't update it?",
  "What should I do if the name shown against my PAN is incorrect and I can't update it?\nThe name linked to your PAN should be accurate for successful identity verification and KYC purposes. Please update your name to match your PAN.\nWhy is my Aadhar required?\nAadhar is mandatory for identification and KYC setup for your account, necessary for processing your FD request.",
  "Do I need a physical copy of my Aadhar?\nNo, a physical copy is not required. We use secure platforms like DigiLocker and CKYC for verifying your Aadhar and other documents.\nWhat is DigiLocker?\nDigiLocker is a government initiative under the Digital India project for storing and verifying documents like PAN card, driving license, Aadhar card, school marksheets, and insurance papers.",
  "What should I do if there's a name mismatch and I can't complete the step?\nFor successful FD booking, the name on your Aadhar and PAN should match. Correct the details on either your PAN or Aadhar card and retry.\nHow can I add a new address as my current address?\nUse the “add” button on the address choice screen to add an address that is not listed.",
  "Use the “add” button on the address choice screen to add an address that is not listed.\nWhat should I do if I can't change my permanent address?\nThe address from your Aadhar is considered your permanent address. You may add or select your current address to proceed with the FD application.\nCan my permanent address be the same as my current address?",
  "Can my permanent address be the same as my current address?\nYes, you can select your permanent address as your current address if they are the same.\nWhy is video KYC required?\nVideo KYC is required to complete the KYC verification step as mandated by the RBI.\nWhat if I am not available during bank working hours?",

  "When can I complete the Video KYC?\nVideo KYC is available from Monday to Saturday, 09:00 AM to 08:00 PM.

  "What should I do if I can't move to the next step and complete my KYC verification?\nRetry using the correct details. If it still doesn’t work, try again later. If the issue persists, raise a ticket with our support team for assistance.\nWhy are details related to occupation, income, and family required for FD booking?",
  "Why are details related to occupation, income, and family required for FD booking?\nThese details are required by the bank to create your fixed deposit and ensure communication if needed.\nWhy is my money deducted before video KYC?",
  "Why is my money deducted before video KYC?\nYour money is deducted before video KYC as it is the last step to verify your identity and book your FD. Your money is safe with the bank, and interest starts accumulating from the time of payment. In case of issues with VKYC, your money will be refunded within 7 working days.\nWhat is required for completing a video KYC?",

  "Cut-off price is the price at which the shares get issued through an IPO to the investors.\nThis price is ascertained at the allotment stage.\nWhen an investor applies for an IPO at a cut-off price, that means he is ready to bid at this price.\nIn an ideal scenario, all retail investors bid at the cut-off price to increase their chance of allotment.",
  "Can I use a bank account not linked with Angel One to apply?\nYou can apply for an IPO using any other bank account provided the account is in the name of the investor.\nCan I apply for an IPO using my bank’s current account?\nIt is preferred that you apply using your savings account as most banks do not process IPO applications submitted using a current account.",
  "You need to check with your bank for more details.\nCan I apply for an IPO using my HUF’s account?\nYou cannot apply via the Angel One app.\nHowever, you can apply using your HUF account through the physical ASBA process with your bank.\nMy daughter is a minor.

  "The Angel One app doesn’t allow a minor to apply.\nAlthough, a minor can apply via physical ASBA process through your bank.\nWhy didn’t my account get debited after applying for an IPO?\nAs per the ASBA process, banks will simply hold/block your money when you apply for an IPO.\nOnce the shares are allotted to you, the amount will be debited from your bank account.",
  "Once the shares are allotted to you, the amount will be debited from your bank account.\nIf the shares are not allotted to you, the amount will be unblocked/released to your account on/before the UPI mandate expiry date.\nNote: Banks usually take 10-15 days to release your funds.\nIf your funds are still blocked after 15 days please contact your bank .\nCan I modify my IPO bid?",
  "If your funds are still blocked after 15 days please contact your bank .\nCan I modify my IPO bid?\nYes, you can modify the lot size and UPI ID of your IPO bid after placing an order.\nPlease note that if you have approved your UPI mandate request for the order and modified the order later, the entire IPO bid amount will be blocked in addition to the amount blocked for your original IPO bid.",

  "How can I get a guaranteed IPO allotment?\nWe would like to explain that Angel One is merely a platform to apply for IPO and has no control over its allotment. IPO allotment can never be guaranteed since, in case of over-subscription, the allotment is done via a lottery system. However, you can avoid application rejection by\nApplying from only 1 Demat account per PAN\nApplying at cut-off price",

  "Bonus Issue\nBuyback\nDividend\nHoldings/Portfolio\nRights Issue\nStock Split\nTPIN\nWhat is Bonus Issue?\nBonus shares are additional shares given by the company to existing shareholders, free of cost, in proportion to the shares held by the shareholder.\nWho is eligible for bonus shares?\nShareholders who own shares of the company on the record date set by the company are eligible for bonus shares.",
  "When will the Bonus shares be credited in my demat account?\nThe bonus shares will get credited to your demat account 10-15 days after the record date.\nIn case you do not receive the same post 15 days from the Record date you can check the status with the Registrar (RTA).\nYou can find the details of the Registrar on the BSE India website by visiting the Corp Information section.",
  "Why has the average price of the stock reduced after receiving bonus shares?\nThe buy price of bonus shares is zero, as they are credited at no cost. When the shares are credited to your account, the quantity of shares increases while the invested value remains unaffected. As a result, the average price of the stock reduces. Be assured that it is correctly calculated by Angel One.\nStill need help?",
