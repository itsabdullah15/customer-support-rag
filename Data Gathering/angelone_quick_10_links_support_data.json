However, sometimes there might be delays if the information uploaded by the user does not fulfill the requirements of the application process. A delayed account opening process causes unnecessary frustration for the user if they do not clearly understand why their application is not being approved.To minimise this friction, the Angel One app now shows you exactly which stage their application is in. This will give you clarity on the status of your application as well as a fair idea about further requirements from your side.How to View Application Status?When you open the Angel One app on the Home Page you will see an option at the bottom of the screen to view the status of your application. Clicking‘View Status’will expand the window and allow you to see the exact stage where your application currently stands.Fig.1:Application Status window on the Home page (left), which can be expanded with a click to a larger view (right).Currently, the application status goes through the following stages in chronological order –Application Submitted –This means that the application,including the e-Sign, has been filled out by you.Application Under Review –This means that the application is currently being reviewed by the Angel One team.Application Rejected –This means that your application has been rejected for some reason, which will be disclosed. For instance, if the rejection is due to submitting an incorrect document, the section mentions the exact document that needs to be resubmitted for the application to be successful.Activation in Progress –This means that your application has been reviewed successfully and only the activation of your account remains to be done.Ready for trade–This means that you can transfer your money and start trading stocks on the app. You can also activate other segments, i.e. F&O, commodity and currency. Just click on the Profile icon, scroll to the bottom and you will find the option to activate derivatives trading.Know more aboutSegment activation.Fig. 2:Application under review (left), application rejected, with the reason (middle) and application successful and permission to start trading (right)Once your account is active, we will send you a Whatsapp notification. However, if there is a rejection status on your application, then we immediately notify you by email and SMS.What to do if the Application is Rejected?Technically your application is not rejected – it is simply stalled until you provide the required information. In case your application is stalled for some reason, you do not have to worry.A member of the Angel One sales team will contact you directly.Causes for Application RejectionThe following are the primary reasons for which your application might be rejected –1. Signature Validation IssueIt means that your signature could not be validated. It could be because the signature itself was not clear/valid or for some other reason. It is one of the top reasons for application rejection, hence make sure the signature you upload is clear and proper.2. PAN Validation IssueThis means that there is currently an issue in the process of validating your PAN (Permanent Account Number). It could be because a clear PAN copy is not uploaded.3. Selfie Validation IssueThis means that your selfie could not be validated because it was not captured clearly.4. Name Mismatch IssueThis means that there is currently an issue of mismatch between the name provided in the application data and the name given in the submitted documents.5. Address Proof Validation IssueThis basically means that there is an issue in validating the address proof because –The QR code on the Aadhaar (proof of address) is not clear.The address proof is not submitted via Aadhaar or Digilocker – hence it needs time to be validated manually.There is a mismatch in the address provided in the application data and the address given in the documents submitted.6. Bank Details Validation IssueThis means that there is an issue in the bank details validation process because –The bank details were submitted via a cheque leaf – hence it is taking time to complete manual validation.In case the details were submitted online, then there was likely an issue of name mismatch between the data in the application and the documents submitted.There could also be other, more specific reasons for application rejection as well, such as  –You already have another application submitted using the same Aadhaar, PAN or email ID.Your name is missing on the bank proof submitted. In that case, you may have to upload or re-upload –A pre-printed cancelled cheque leaf with your name and account number clearly mentioned on the same, orA pre-printed bank passbook or statement with your name, account number and IFSC code on the same.A change in name is required. In that case, kindly provide a gazette or marriage certificate.Other details, such as date of birth, user’s father’s name, etc. is not correct/matching.If the name on PAN is correct, then Bank Verification Letter is still required, and if Bank Proof is correct, then additional ID proof is still required.ConclusionHope this article clears doubts regarding the application process of Angel One.Angel One is committed to bringing you the best features possible to make your experience on the app seamless.

The financial market is divided into different segments with unique trading rules to simplify investing in various categories. Hence, if you want to trade in agricultural commodities like cotton and coffee and the shares of ABC company, you can’t do it under one segment. You have to trade them separately in different exchanges from your broker’s platform or app, like Angel One. Separate categories facilitate trading and transactions. So, if you want toinvest in multiple asset classes, you need to enable the segment in the Angel One app.Types of Segments:Following are the various segments of the stock market.Equity Cash (Capital Market)It classifies all the transactions involving buying and selling of shares listed on the exchange. In India, stocks from listed companies trade inNSE(National Stock Exchange) andBSE(Bombay Stock Exchange). So, you will have to activate the equity segment in theAngel Oneapp to transact in theequity market.Mutual FundsMutual Fundis a financial instrument in which funds are collected from multiple investors to invest in assets such as stocks, money market instruments (Certificate of Deposit, Commercial Paper, Treasury Bills, and Call Money), and bonds. With Angel One’s Mutual Funds segment, you can invest in various Mutual Funds either in lumpsum or through SIP.Equity & Index F&OAn equity derivativeis a class of financial contracts that invest in equities as the underlying asset (equity stocks/shares in the secondary market). For instance – Reliance Futures is an equity derivative. Its price varies with the movements of the Reliance Share Price. Similarly, for anindex-basedderivative, the underlying asset is a group of indices such asNIFTY,BANK NIFTY, andFINNIFTY. In this segment, you can trade only in the group of assets and not in the individual security.Futures and Optionsare the two derivatives available for trading in this segment. In the Futures contract, an investor agrees to buy/sell a particular asset at an agreed-upon rate on a future date. However, in the Options contract, the investor has a right, but is under no obligation to buy/sell the underlying asset at a specific price on a fixed date.With Angel One, you can trade in futures and options in segment.CommoditiesIndian investors can diversify their portfolio by investing in various commodities like gold, crude oil, copper, cardamom, rubber, and energy in the Commodities market.MCX(Multi-Commodity Exchange) andNCDEX(National Commodity and Derivatives Exchange of India) are the two exchanges under the Commodity segment at Angel One.NCDEX has leadership in agro-products, while MCX predominantly leads the gold, metal, and oil markets.Foreign ExchangesIf you want to invest in foreign currencies, you will have to activate the currency segment. It allows you to buy and sell foreign currencies at market rates electronically. One invests in the Forex market for various reasons – gaining exposure to the largest market in the world, portfolio diversification, and profit opportunities from fluctuating currency rates in the international market. Major participants in this segment are corporations, central banks, retail forex brokers, hedge funds, and individual investors. You can activate the NSE-FX segment at the Angel One platform to trade in theForex market.How Do I Check Which Segments Are Activated?To check which segments are currently activated on your Angel One account, follow these steps:Go to your profile on the mobile app orweb platform.You can usethis linkas well to directly access your segment detailsThere you can see the activated categories under the ‘Manage Segment’ section.Why Do We Need to Activate Segments?The right mix of equity, future & options, commodities, and currency can help build a diversified portfolio while earning good returns.

This process of transferring funds to a registered bank account is known as Funds Payout.In this article, we answer some of the key questions that users may have related to withdrawing funds from their Angel One account.When will the funds be credited to my account once I have placed a funds payout request?In Angel One, funds payout requests are processed twice a day for the convenience of traders. We will process your funds payout request as per the timeline given below.DaysPayout Request TimeFunds Credited By (approx)Monday to Friday12:00 am – 07:00 am11:30 am, Same Day07:00 am – 05:30 pm11:30 pm, Same Day05:30 pm – 12:00 am11:30 am, Next Working DaySuppose you have ₹1000 in your withdrawable balance on Monday.If you place a withdrawal request of ₹500 on Monday 11 am (i.e. between 7:00 am to 5:30 pm), your request will be processed at 5:30 pm, and you will receive credit by 11:30 pm.If you place a withdrawal request on Monday at 6 pm (i.e. between 5:30 pm today and 7:00 am of the next working day), your request will be processed at 7:00 am on Tuesday, and you will receive funds in your account by 11:30 am on Tuesday.Please Note:Angel One will process payout requests only on settlement days. After you place a request, funds will be credited according to thepayout cyclesas above.Any request received after the cut-off time/day will be processed on the next settlement/working day.Payout requests and credits will not be processed on Saturday, Sunday, and onNSE Clearing Holidays(Maharashtra Bank Holidays).Below is the list of NSE Clearing Holidays –Sr. NoDateDayDescription119-Feb-2025WednesdayChhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Jayanti226-Feb-2025WednesdayMahashivratri314-Mar-2025FridayHoli431-Mar-2025MondayId-Ul-Fitr (Ramadan Eid)501-Apr-2025TuesdayAnnual Bank closing610-Apr-2025ThursdayShri Mahavir Jayanti714-Apr-2025MondayDr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar Jayanti818-Apr-2025FridayGood Friday901-May-2025ThursdayMaharashtra Day1012-May-2025MondayBuddha Pournima1115-Aug-2025FridayIndependence Day / Parsi New Year1227-Aug-2025WednesdayShri Ganesh Chaturthi1305-Sep-2025FridayId-E-Milad1402-Oct-2025ThursdayMahatma Gandhi Jayanti/Dussehra1521-Oct-2025TuesdayDiwali Laxmi Pujan1622-Oct-2025WednesdayBalipratipada1705-Nov-2025WednesdayPrakash Gurpurb Sri Guru Nanak Dev1825-Dec-2025ThursdayChristmasWhy is my withdrawable balance zero or not matching my trading account balance?You have unsettled balances in your account. It can happen because of the following reasons:For delivery sell transactions: You can withdraw the amount on T+1 day (Next working day).For example – You have a ₹1000 delivery sell transaction on Monday. You can withdraw these on Tuesday. So on Monday, you will see withdrawable balance as zero and unsettled balance as ₹1000..Funds received from exiting F&O positions can be withdrawn on T +1 day (next working day).For example – You have a ₹1000 F&O sell transaction on Monday. You can withdraw these on Tuesday. So on Monday, you will see the withdrawable balance as zero and the unsettled balance as ₹1000.Funds that you have added during the day can be withdrawn on the following day.For example, if you added ₹1000 on Monday, you will still be able to see the withdrawable balance as Zero on Monday. Say you add ₹500 on Tuesday. Your withdrawable balance will be ₹1000 (which you had added earlier that day. The ₹500 of today will not be visible in your withdrawable balance).I added funds to my account today, but I am not able to withdraw them today. Why?Funds added cannot be withdrawn on the same day. They can be withdrawn only on  T+1 day (the next working day) onwards. For example, if you added ₹10,000 on 22-Nov-22, then you can withdraw it only on 23-Nov-22.Please Note:If you have added funds through Net Banking/Payment Aggregator, you can place a withdrawal request only after the funds are settled through the banking channel.I have placed the withdrawal request, but my trading balance has not been reduced why?Kindly check if the next payout cycle has started yet. If not, the withdrawal request will be processed only once the payout cycle has started. Overall, the withdrawal process also takes the minimum processing time.Until the payout cycle starts, you can still trade assets using the entire available balance, even if you have placed a withdrawal request. For example, you have ₹1000 in your account and have placed a withdrawal request for the entire amount. But the amount has not been withdrawn yet, while the stock market has already opened. At this point, say you buy a stock worth ₹200 – so ₹200 is used up while ₹800 remains. Therefore, when the withdrawal happens, only ₹800 will be withdrawn. The remaining ₹200 withdrawal will be executed once the account again has ₹200 or more.Why have I received only a partial amount against my funds payout request?You have received partial funds against your withdrawal because of either of the following reasons:Margin requirementsInitiated new tradeAccrual chargesFor example:Assume you have ₹1000 as a withdrawable balance at the beginning of the day i.e. 9:00 am. And you have placed a funds payout request of ₹1000. After placing the request, you entered into an intraday trade and suffered a loss of Rs. 100 (including Brokerage, Taxes, and other statutory charges), leaving your clear ledger balance to be ₹900. Hence, when your withdrawal request is processed, you will receive ₹900 in your account and not ₹1000. In this case, the loss of ₹100 due to the intraday transaction modified the amount you received. Similarly, if there is any change in the margin requirements or any accrual charges that need payment, you will receive only a partial amount.Why is my funds payout request rejected?Your withdrawal request can be rejected for the following reasons:You have entered a new tradeThe margin requirement has changedInadequate balance in your accountI have sold the shares from my Demat account. When can I transfer the funds to my bank account?As per the settlement cycle, you can place funds withdrawal requests on the following days. For delivery sell transactions and F&O transactions, funds payout requests can be placed on T+1 day (Next working day).I have made a BTST (Buy Today, Sell Tomorrow) trade. When can I place a funds payout request?In BTST transactions, withdrawal requests can be placed on T+1 day (The next working day) after the selling transaction is executed.I have 2 bank accounts. I want to receive funds from my secondary bank account. What should I do?While withdrawing,Angel Onegives you the option to select a bank account in which you want to receive the funds. The amount will get credited to the bank account you have chosen.I have placed multiple withdrawal requests. Why was only one request processed at a time?If you place multiple withdrawal requests with different bank accounts within the payout cycle, the system will process only one bank’s withdrawal request at a time. The other withdrawal requests will remain pending until the next payout processing cycle.For example:If you place a withdrawal request on Monday at 11:00 am for Bank A and at 12:00 pm for Bank B (i.e., between 07:00 am and 05:30 pm), only one of the payout requests (i.e., either Bank A or Bank B) will be processed at 05:30 pm and credited to your account by 11:30 pm.The payout request of Bank B will be processed in the next payout cycle (i.e., on Tuesday at 7:00 am) and credited to your account by 11:30 am on Tuesday.Before you leave, let us go over the entire funds payout process.Withdrawal of Funds from Your Angel One AccountWith Angel One, you can easily place a funds payout (withdrawal) request on our platform and receive it directly in the bank account linked to your trading account. The benefits of using an Angel One trading account are:You can attach multiple bank accounts with the correct bank details.No restriction as to receiving funds only in your primary bank account. You can receive money in your selected bank account.Before making funds withdrawal requests, you must check the “Withdrawable Balance” in your account. You should also know that the “Withdrawable Balance” may be less than the “Funds” available as a portion may be withheld againstMargin requirementsBrokerage chargesOther statutory charges, etc.The funds payout process with Angel One is entirely digital and straightforward.Follow the below steps to withdraw funds.Go to the ‘Account’ section after logging inClick the ‘Withdraw’ buttonEnter the amount you want to withdraw from the withdrawable balance and click the bank to which you want the money to be withdrawn.Click ‘Proceed’ to submit the requestFigure 1: Process of withdrawal of fundsWhen can I place a withdrawal request in case of sell transactions?As per the settlement cycle, you can place a funds payout request on the below-mentioned days.For delivery sell transactions, a payout request can be placed on the T+1 day (next working day).For F&O transactions, fund payout requests can be placed on T+1 day (next working day).For example, you have sold equity shares of ABC Limited on Monday. In that case, your funds will be released on T+1 day (The next working day), i.e. Tuesday, assuming that there are no trading holidays between Monday and Tuesday. So, you will be able to place the funds payout request on Tuesday.What are the different types of balances that you should look at?Withdrawable balance– The total available balance in your account that can be withdrawn from your bank account is the withdrawable balance. The withdrawable amount can differ from the total trading balance shown in your trading account.Unsettled balance– If a user earns a profit today and tries to withdraw the amount today, even though the amount from all the transactions has not been settled yet, then this amount is counted as an unsettled balance.Total balance– The total balance can be found by adding the withdrawable balance and the unsettled balance – it is the total amount that the user is entitled to at that point in time.Update your bank account detailsIFSC codes and account numbers have been changed for several banks due to the recent mergers. For example, the Oriental Bank of Commerce & United Bank of India merged with the Punjab National Bank and more.  So, if your bank has recently merged or amalgamated, then please make sure that your account number and IFSC code are updated on our app. The old IFSC code will not be valid for any of the online transactions. For some of the users account numbers might have been changed too. So, to continue enjoying hassle-free pay-ins/payouts with Angel One, you need to ensure that your bank details, like IFSC code, account number, etc., are correct. You can do so online by visiting theprofilesection of our app.Check the below table to know if your bank is on the list of merged banks.Merged BanksAcquired byAndhra BankUnion Bank of IndiaCorporation BankOriental Bank of CommercePunjab National BankUnited Bank of IndiaAllahabad BankIndian BankSyndicate BankCanara BankVijaya BankBank of BarodaDena BankState Bank of Bikaner and JaipurState Bank of IndiaState Bank of HyderabadState Bank of MysoreState Bank of PatialaState Bank of TravancoreBharatiya Mahila BankHow can I check the status of my withdrawal request?You can easily check the status and other details of your requests for withdrawals as well as other transactions. To do so, visit the “ACCOUNT” section of the app, go to the section named “VIEW FUNDS TRANSACTION DETAILS”, and then view the “Funds Withdrawn”. Under the Funds Withdrawn section, you can click on any of your withdrawal requests and view its details, such as thestatus of the request and theexpected credit time of the requested amount in your bank account.Figure 2:Transaction details (left) and  section individual withdrawal details section (right)Can I cancel my withdrawal request?Yes, if the payout cycle has not started yet, you can cancel your withdrawal request. For example, if you made a withdrawal request at 6:30 am on a Monday morning, you can easily cancel it at 6:50 am because the payout cycle does not start until 7:00 am on Mondays. You can check from the above table when Angel One’s payout cycles are effective.For non-traded users, the processing of the request for funds withdrawal starts within a few minutes of the placement of the request. However, you can still cancel the request if you can send your request for cancellation within that time window.Regarding your funds payout rejection and limit updation?AOL shall endeavour to give the payout rejection effect in ledger within T+1 Working day. Kindly know that trading limits or withdrawable balances in such a case will reflect within T+2 working days only after the payout rejection information is shared by the bank.ConclusionTransferring funds from your trading account to your bank account is hassle-free and convenient with Angel One.

As a trader or investor today, you can conveniently trade or invest in the market from the comfort of your home. For this, all you have to do is place an order via trading platforms likeAngel One, which in turn places an order with the exchange on your behalf.Before we move further, let’s define what order and order status are. Order means an instruction that you give on a trading platform to buy/sell scrips at a particular price. And order status tells you the up-to-date situation of the trading order you have placed.Various order statuses on the Angel One platformEach order submitted on the Angel One platform will show a status that might change during the course of trade. The below list shows all possible order statuses on our platform.ExecutedAn order that has been successfully completed at the exchange is said to be executed.PendingAn order is in pending status when it has been sent to the exchange but is in an open position because of either of the following reasons:Your buying price is less than theask priceYour selling price is higher than thebid priceYour order is partially executed (means only a part of your total order is executed)YourStop Loss Orderafter the trigger price is reached and the order is not yet executed (assuming that 1st leg of your order is executed)YourRoBo Orderafter the trigger/target price is reached and the order is not yet executed (assuming that 1st leg of your order is executed)The order status will be pending unless your trade is successfully executed. Apart from this, AMO orders, which means the orders that are placed when the market is closed, can be seen under the pending orders section.RejectedAngel One has an exhaustive list of validations like insufficient funds, bid/ask price should fall within the circuit limit (a range within which the stock orders can be placed for the day), trading in penny stocks, trading in SME group stocks, etc. to execute the order successfully. If your order doesn’t comply with these validations, then your order will be rejected even before it reaches the exchange.CanceledAn order goes into a canceled status because of the below-mentioned reasons:1. You have initiated the cancellation2. You are placing anIOC(Immediate or Cancelled) order, which means you are placing an order that needs to be executed immediately and if that does not happen then it should be canceled3. You have placed an order with day validity but your bid/ask price does not get hit, so the order will be automatically canceled at the end of the trading day i.e., forF&Oit will be auto-canceled at 03:30 pm, and for cash segment at 04:00 pmHow to check your order status on our app?1.Click on Orders Tab at the bottom.Click on Open Orders tab on top3.Click on Order History.4.Click on any order to view detailed message for rejections.Note:Only terminal statuses are shown in order history, i.e. only executed, rejected and cancelled. Pending orders are not shown in order history as it has still not reached terminal stateConclusionIt is imperative to understand different order statuses on our platform so that you know when your order gets executed and when you need to re-order.

We will learn more of this from the later section on View Funds Transaction Details.How to check if the transaction is reflected on the funds in your account?Once a transaction is executed, you may check whether the transaction is reflected in your balance. For that, you must go to your Account and check your Trading Balance or click “View Funds Transaction Details”. If you find that the balance is not updated, then try switching to another section (such as Home or Watchlist) and then come back again to Account. The balance should be updated by then.Withdraw fundsFollow these steps in order to withdraw funds –Go to the ‘Account’ section after logging inClick the ‘Withdraw’ buttonCheck the withdrawable amount.Enter the amount that you want to withdraw from the withdrawable balance amountClick the bank you want the money to be withdrawn to.Click proceed to submit the requestOverall, the remainder of the withdrawal process and checking of withdrawal status is quite similar to the process of adding funds, especially with respect to “View Funds Transaction Details”.Figure:Funds withdrawal processQuick questionsWhat are the different types of balances that you should look at?Withdrawable balance– The total available balance in your account that can be withdrawn to your bank account is the withdrawable balance. The withdrawable amount can differ from the total trading balance shown in your trading account.Unsettled balance– If a user earns a profit today and tries to withdraw the amount today itself, even though the amount from all the transactions has not been settled yet, then this amount is counted as unsettled balance.Total balance– The total balance can be found by adding the withdrawable balance and the unsettled balance – it is the total amount that the user is entitled to at that point of time.When can funds withdrawal requests be placed?As per the settlement cycle, you can place funds withdrawal requests on the following days. For delivery sell transactions, funds payout requests can be placed on T+2 day. For F&O transactions, funds payout requests can be placed on T+1 day.I have received money through a sell transaction but my withdrawable balance still shows zero money. Why is this so?It takes time for the transaction to be settled. Therefore, until the settlement of the money involved in the sell transaction has happened, the withdrawable balance will not change. Once the settlement has happened you will see the change in your withdrawal balance.Payout cyclesIn Angel One, funds payout requests are processed three times a day for the convenience of traders.We will process your funds payout request as per the timeline given below:Note:Payout marking after cut-off time for the day will be processed on the next working day as per the payout cycle.ExplanationFor example – You have ₹1000 in your withdrawable balance on Monday.•You place a withdrawal request of ₹500 on Monday 11 am. Your request will be processed at 5:30 pm and you will receive credit by 9:30 pm.•You place a withdrawal request on Monday 6 pm. Your request will be processed at 7:00 am on Tuesday and you will receive credit by 9:30 am on Tuesday.Until the payout cycle starts, you can still trade assets using the entire available balance, even if you have placed a withdrawal request. For example you have₹1000 in your account and have placed a withdrawal request for the entire amount. But the amount has not been withdrawn yet, while the stock market has already opened. At this point, say you buy a stock worth ₹200 – so ₹200 is used up while ₹800 remains. Therefore, when the withdrawal happens, only ₹800 will be withdrawn. The remaining ₹200 withdrawal will be executed once the account again has ₹200 or more.Other reasons for partial withdrawalsPartial withdrawals can also occur because of any of the following reasons:Margin requirementsInitiated new tradeAccrual chargesFor example: Assume you have Rs. 1000 as a withdrawable balance at the beginning of the day i.e. 9:00 am. And you have placed a funds payout request of Rs. 1000. After placing the request, you entered into an intraday trade and suffered a loss of Rs. 100 (including Brokerage, Taxes, and other statutory charges), leaving your clear ledger balance to be Rs. 900. Hence, when your withdrawal request is processed, you will receive Rs. 900 in your account and not Rs. 1000. In this case, the loss of Rs. 100 due to the intraday transaction modified the amount you received. Similarly, if there is any change in the margin requirements or any accrual charges that need payment, you will receive only a partial amount.Why is my withdrawable balance zero or not matching my trading account balance?It may happen because you have unsettled balances in your account. This can happen because of the following reasons:•In case of delivery sell transactions,•You can use only 80% of the amount to trade on T day (i.e. the day the transaction was executed), and you can withdraw the same on T+2 day.•You can use the remaining 20% for trading or withdraw it only on T+2 day.•For example – You have a ₹1000 delivery sell transaction on Monday. You can withdraw these on Wednesday. So on Monday and Tuesday, you will see withdrawable balance as zero and unsettled balance as ₹1000.•Funds received from exiting F&O position can be withdrawn on the next working day•For example, suppose you have a ₹1000 F&O sell transaction on Monday. You can withdraw these on Tuesday. So on Monday, you will see withdrawable balance as zero and unsettled balance as ₹1000.•Funds that you have added during the day can be withdrawn on the following day•For example, suppose you have added ₹1000 on Monday, still you will be able to see withdrawable balance as Zero on Monday. Say, you add ₹500 on next day i.e. Tuesday. Your withdrawable balance will be ₹1000 (which you had added earlier day. The ₹500 of today will not be visible in withdrawable balance).I have added funds in my account but I am not able to withdraw them today itself?Funds added cannot be withdrawn on the same day itself. They can be withdrawn only on the next day (t+1) onwards. For example, if you have added ₹10,000 on Nov 22, 2022, then you can withdraw it only on Nov 23, 2022.Why is my funds payout request rejected?Your withdrawal request can get rejected for the following reasons:You have entered a new tradeMargin requirement has changedInadequate balance in your accountCan I withdraw funds to a secondary bank account that I have?While withdrawing,Angel Onegives you the option to select a bank account in which you want to receive the funds. The amount will get credited to the bank account you have chosen.Can I cancel my withdrawal request?Yes, if the payout cycle has not started yet, you can cancel your withdrawal request.For example, if you have made a withdrawal request at 6:30 am on a monday morning you can easily cancel the withdrawal request at 6:50 am, because the payout cycle does not start until 7:00 am on Mondays. You can check from the above table when the payout cycles of Angel One are effective.For non-traded users, the processing of the request for funds withdrawal starts within  a few minutes of the placement of the request. However, you can still cancel the request if you can send your request for cancellation within that time window.How to update your bank account details?IFSC codes and account numbers have been changed for several banks due to the recent mergers. For example, Oriental Bank of Commerce & United Bank of India merged with the Punjab National Bank and more.  So, if your bank has recently merged or amalgamated then please make sure that your account number and IFSC code is updated on our app. As the old IFSC code will not be valid for any of the online transactions. For some of the users account numbers might have been changed too. So, to continue enjoying hassle-free pay-ins/payouts with Angel One, you need to ensure that your bank details like IFSC code, account number, etc. are correct. You can do so online by visiting theprofilesection of our app.Check the below table to know if your bank is in the list of merged banks.View Funds Transaction DetailsUnder this section you can view two sections – funds added and funds withdrawn.Funds AddedUnder this section you can check all the fund additions made by you along with the following information –Date and time of the transactionThe bank a/c from which the transaction was madeThe amount involvedThe status of the transaction – e.g. PendingIf you are concerned about transactions related to a particular bank or even a particular amount, then you can directly search for the transaction by entering the bank name or the amount in the search bar.Funds WithdrawnTo the right of Funds Added, you will find the section of Funds Withdrawn. It will show the exact same details, just for the list of funds withdrawn.Figure: Process of checking funds withdrawal status – funds withdrawn section from view funds transaction details (left) and individual transaction details (right).Statement SummaryYou can also view a Statement Summary of all your transactions done in a particular time period – it is basically a ledger. In this section you will find the opening and closing balances in that period as well as the credit and debit amounts.You can change the period for which you are viewing the summary by clicking the dates mentioned above – from there you can choose any of the standard periods i.e. last 7, 15 or 30 days or 3 or 6 months or even the year till date or the financial year. You can also choose a custom period by clicking “custom” and choosing the dates ( from *date* to *date*) for the period you want to view.If you want, you can also download the statement summary by clicking on the download icon on the top right corner.Stock PledgingIn intraday and F&O trades, the buyer does not always have to pay the entire amount – he/she can pay a fraction (or margin) of the asset price to the seller and the rest can be paid off by the stockbroker (in this case, Angel One). Angel One pays off the remaining portion of the transaction value in the form of a loan given out to the buyer. Now in order to avail this loan facility, the buyers would have to pledge delivery stocks in their possession.The process of adding stocks to be pledged is the following –1. Go to Account and click on “Pledge stocks”2. Check the “Margin Pledge” – if it is too low, click increase3. The list of stocks that can be pledged appears4. You may increase the quantity of stocks pledged5. Once you have adequate margin allocated, click “Increase Margin”Figure:The process of adding stocks pledged – Part 16. Thereafter you will receive a request for OTP verification7. Once the OTP is verified, you will reach the CDSL page where you will be able to verify the Margin Pledge transaction.Once the process is completed, it takes roughly 15-20 minutes for the increase in margin to be reflected in the trading balance summary.The process of withdrawing stocks pledged is also the same.Figure: The process of adding stocks pledged – Part 2MTFMTF or Margin trading facility allows users to trade in assets without paying the full amount that the asset is worth in the market – the user has to pay only a fraction of the amount while the rest is paid by the broker (in this case, Angel One). In order to avail this service, the user must pledge some assets (e.g. stocks).The process is as follows –You will receive a request from the CDSL to pledge assets for the Margin Trading Facility provided by your broker.Once the request is placed, a link will be sent to the registered email/sms at 5:30 pm on the same day.Open the link and authenticate it by entering PAN and OTP before 9:00 pm on the same day.On successful validation, the pledge will be created and an intimation will be sent.DashThe Angel One Dash is the most open, easy-to-use trading transactions management tool available to Indian traders today.
