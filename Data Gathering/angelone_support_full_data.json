Surveillance Measure is an initative by the regulatory bodies and exchanges to protect traders and investors by monitoring price and volatility and detecting misleading activities like insider trading, fictitious transactions, and more.\nWhat is ASM?\nSEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India) along with the stock exchanges have initiated an Additional Surveillance Measure or ASM to safeguard investors’ interests by ensuring there are no market speculations or manipulations like unexpected price movements. The stocks are categorized under ASM for surveillance based on criteria specified by NSE\nhere\n.\nWhat is GSM?\nGSM or Graded Surveillance Measure is a system used by Indian Stock Exchanges like NSE and BSE to alert traders/investors and ask them to be extra cautious while dealing in certain securities which have been categorized under GSM. Scrips can be classified under GSM due to abnormal price hike that doesn’t match with the company’s financial health, are illiquid, have negligible market capital, and are underpreforming.\nWhat is the difference between ASM and GSM?\nThe main aim of the ASM framework is to control stock volatility, while the primary objective of GSM is to protect the investors from underperforming stocks by not allowing intraday trading and to advise them to be extra vigilant while dealing with securities that are witnessing unusual price fluctuations. Both these frameworks are introduced with different objectives, but their main goal is to protect traders and investors.\nWhat is the basis of categorizing a scrip under ASM?\nSEBI and Exchanges jointly decides the objective criterion to shortlist securities under ASM based on the following parameters:\n1. High Low Variation\n2. Client Concentration\n3. Close to Close Price Variation\n4. Market Capitalization\n5. Volume Variation\n6. Delivery Percentage\n7. No. of Unique PANs & PEs\nWhen will a scrip be classified under GSM?\nOn the basis of below-mentioned pointers, Regulatory Body and the Exchanges make their decision of adding a scrip under GSM category:\n1. Periodic Call Auction Session for Illiquid Securities\n2. Periodic Review of Movement of Securities to/from Trade for Trade\n3. Persistent Noise Creators\n4.

A mismatch will result in your application being rejected by the bank.\nWhy are permissions to send SMS and access phone state required?\nThese permissions are needed to verify your mobile number by sending an SMS. Rest assured, these permissions are used solely for verification purposes.\nCan I link any SIM for FD purchase if I have a dual SIM phone?\nYes, you can. However, we recommend using the SIM registered with your bank account for authentication.\nCan I retry the registration if it was not successful earlier?\nYes, you can retry. Ensure you use the SIM linked to your bank account for authentication.\nCan I invest in FD if I do not have a PAN?\nNo, currently, we only process fixed deposit requests for individuals with an active PAN.\nWhy is my PAN not getting verified?\nFor booking fixed deposits, we need to verify your PAN with the regulated authorities. If there is a mismatch, the booking cannot be completed.\nWhat should I do if the name shown against my PAN is incorrect and I can't update it?\nThe name linked to your PAN should be accurate for successful identity verification and KYC purposes. Please update your name to match your PAN.\nWhy is my Aadhar required?\nAadhar is mandatory for identification and KYC setup for your account, necessary for processing your FD request.\nDo I need a physical copy of my Aadhar?\nNo, a physical copy is not required. We use secure platforms like DigiLocker and CKYC for verifying your Aadhar and other documents.\nWhat is DigiLocker?\nDigiLocker is a government initiative under the Digital India project for storing and verifying documents like PAN card, driving license, Aadhar card, school marksheets, and insurance papers.\nWhat should I do if there's a name mismatch and I can't complete the step?\nFor successful FD booking, the name on your Aadhar and PAN should match. Correct the details on either your PAN or Aadhar card and retry.\nHow can I add a new address as my current address?\nUse the “add” button on the address choice screen to add an address that is not listed.\nWhat should I do if I can't change my permanent address?\nThe address from your Aadhar is considered your permanent address. You may add or select your current address to proceed with the FD application.\nCan my permanent address be the same as my current address?\nYes, you can select your permanent address as your current address if they are the same.\nWhy is video KYC required?\nVideo KYC is required to complete the KYC verification step as mandated by the RBI.\nWhat if I am not available during bank working hours?\nIf you have made the payment, we will notify you when the bank officers are available. If video KYC is not completed within 3 days, your money will be refunded to your bank account.\nWhen can I complete the Video KYC?\nVideo KYC is available from Monday to Saturday, 09:00 AM to 08:00 PM. We will notify you to complete the video KYC during these hours if pending.\nWhat if video KYC fails?\nYou can retry during banking hours within 2 days of FD booking if your video KYC fails.\nHow will I know the status of my video KYC?\nYour video KYC details are verified by bank officers, which may take up to 3 hours. Track the video KYC and FD confirmation status on the ‘My Investments’ tab.\nWhat should I do if I can't move to the next step and complete my KYC verification?\nRetry using the correct details. If it still doesn’t work, try again later. If the issue persists, raise a ticket with our support team for assistance.\nWhy are details related to occupation, income, and family required for FD booking?\nThese details are required by the bank to create your fixed deposit and ensure communication if needed.\nWhy is my money deducted before video KYC?\nYour money is deducted before video KYC as it is the last step to verify your identity and book your FD. Your money is safe with the bank, and interest starts accumulating from the time of payment. In case of issues with VKYC, your money will be refunded within 7 working days.\nWhat is required for completing a video KYC?\nKeep your PAN Card and a blank paper with a pen ready for the VKYC process.\nStill need help?\nCreate Ticket\nWant to connect with us?\nOur experts will be happy to assist you\nConnect with us\nStill have any queries?

Can I apply for an IPO?\nIn case you don’t have a UPI ID, you can create it with any of the UPI Handles featured in the NPCI list.\nAlternatively, you can apply through ASBA with your bank or through physical form.\nHow can I create my UPI ID?\nYou can follow the below steps to create a UPI ID with the BHIM app\nDownload the Google Pay/ PhonePe / BHIM App\nVerify your mobile number\nRegister the passcode (it is required to open the app)\nSelect your bank from the options available\nThe app will fetch your bank details\nIn case you have more than one account, choose the account you want to register with BHIM\nSet up a UPI PIN for security\nNow you can check your UPI ID in the profile section.\nWhy am I unable to apply for IPOs via my UPI ID/Handle?\nFor IPO applications, only UPI ID/Handles approved by NPCI are allowed.\nIn case you are unable to apply for IPO using your UPI ID/Handle, we recommend that you check the list of banks/apps approved by NPCI for providing UPI service for IPO application.\nWhy can’t I see my UPI handle listed in the dropdown in the Angel One app while applying for an IPO?\nIn case you can’t find your UPI Handle in the dropdown list on the IPO page in the Angel One app, it means your UPI Handle is not approved by NPCI for applying for an IPO.\nTry to use or create an alternative UPI ID with any of the entities featured on the NPCI list.\nWhen will I receive my UPI mandate request after placing an order?\nBelow are a few things you can do:\nGo to your Payment App – Navigate to the mandate section and check if you have an open mandate or not.\nIn case you have received many mandates then you can cross verify with the Application ID mentioned in the mandate details with the Application ID mentioned in the order details from Angel One’s Application\nOR\nMake sure your Payments App is updated.\nOR\nIf it is taking longer than 6 hours then cancel your bid from Angel one’s application and place a new bid.\nHow to approve an IPO mandate request?\nYou have to approve the IPO mandate request in your UPI app.\nBy when can I approve the UPI mandate request?\nPending mandates shall expire after 5 PM on the last day. So users should accept the mandate before 5 PM on the last day to participate in the IPO.\nWhat are the charges of applying for an IPO?\nWith Angel One, there are no charges to apply for an IPO.\nHow can an NRI apply for an IPO using the Angel One app?\nNRI’s can not apply via the Angel One app.\nHowever, they can apply through the physical ASBA (Application Supported By Blocked Amount) process with your bank.\nWhat is the cut-off price & why should I apply at a cut-off price?\nCut-off price is the price at which the shares get issued through an IPO to the investors.\nThis price is ascertained at the allotment stage.\nWhen an investor applies for an IPO at a cut-off price, that means he is ready to bid at this price.\nIn an ideal scenario, all retail investors bid at the cut-off price to increase their chance of allotment.\nCan I use a bank account not linked with Angel One to apply?\nYou can apply for an IPO using any other bank account provided the account is in the name of the investor.\nCan I apply for an IPO using my bank’s current account?\nIt is preferred that you apply using your savings account as most banks do not process IPO applications submitted using a current account.\nYou need to check with your bank for more details.\nCan I apply for an IPO using my HUF’s account?\nYou cannot apply via the Angel One app.\nHowever, you can apply using your HUF account through the physical ASBA process with your bank.\nMy daughter is a minor. Can I apply for an IPO using her account?\nThe Angel One app doesn’t allow a minor to apply.\nAlthough, a minor can apply via physical ASBA process through your bank.\nWhy didn’t my account get debited after applying for an IPO?\nAs per the ASBA process, banks will simply hold/block your money when you apply for an IPO.\nOnce the shares are allotted to you, the amount will be debited from your bank account.\nIf the shares are not allotted to you, the amount will be unblocked/released to your account on/before the UPI mandate expiry date.\nNote: Banks usually take 10-15 days to release your funds.\nIf your funds are still blocked after 15 days please contact your bank .\nCan I modify my IPO bid?\nYes, you can modify the lot size and UPI ID of your IPO bid after placing an order.\nPlease note that if you have approved your UPI mandate request for the order and modified the order later, the entire IPO bid amount will be blocked in addition to the amount blocked for your original IPO bid.\nYou will also receive another UPI mandate request for your modified bid.\nHowever, if you haven’t approved the original mandate request, no amount will be blocked for the original IPO bid.\nWhy is my IPO application rejected?\nFew of the common reasons your IPO application is rejected\nYou might have entered the wrong UPI ID or UPI PIN while approving the mandate\nEnsuring that the Bank A/c, Demat A/c, and UPI ID are mapped to the same PAN\nFor example: Jack is using Jill’s UPI ID to apply for an IPO with his Demat A/c. In such a case, Jack’s application will be rejected because\nJill’s bank account used is not linked to the demat account of Jack\nJill’s UPI ID used is not linked to Jack’s PAN\nWhen will my funds be blocked and unblocked?\nYour funds will be blocked once you approve the UPI mandate request for IPO.\nYour funds will be unblocked/released on or before the UPI mandate expiry date if the shares are not allotted through IPO.\nPlease reach out to your bank in case funds are not unblocked/released post the mandate expiry date.\nHow can I get a guaranteed IPO allotment?\nWe would like to explain that Angel One is merely a platform to apply for IPO and has no control over its allotment. IPO allotment can never be guaranteed since, in case of over-subscription, the allotment is done via a lottery system. However, you can avoid application rejection by\nApplying from only 1 Demat account per PAN\nApplying at cut-off price\nEnsuring that the Bank A/c, Demat A/c, and UPI ID are mapped to the same PAN\nFor example: Jack is using Jill’s UPI ID to apply for an IPO with his Demat A/c. In such a case, Jack’s application will be rejected because\nJill’s bank A/C used is not linked to the Demat A/c of Jack\nJill’s UPI ID used is not linked to Jack’s PAN\nWhere can I check my refund status in case of a rejected/non-allotted IPO application?\nBanks will simply hold/block your money when you apply for an IPO.\nSo, your funds will be released/unblocked on or before the UPI mandate expiry date.\nPlease reach out to your bank in case funds are not unblocked or released post the mentioned date.\nWhy didn’t I get my IPO allotment?\nCommon reasons why you didn’t get the allotment are\nNon-Allotment – Allotment is done through lottery system because of over-subscription\nRejection – Application can be rejected due to either of the following reasons:\n1) Application received from multiple Demat accounts having the same PAN\n2) Bank account Demat account, and UPI ID used for an application not mapped to the same PAN\n3) Your bid price is lower than the final issue price\nIs tax applicable on profit from an IPO?\nTax will be levied on your profit as per your tax bracket.\nWhen is the next IPO coming?\nVisit our website https://www.angelone.in/upcoming-IPO to get all information about forthcoming IPO’s.\nI have approved the mandate request, but the status on the Angel One app is still pending. What to do?\nYour UPI mandate request status on the Angel One app does not get updated in real-time.\nIt will reflect shortly in your IPO order book.\nCan I withdraw/delete/cancel my IPO bid?\nFor an IPO application process in the Angel One app, withdrawing, deleting, and canceling the application is the same thing.\nFollow the below path to withdraw/cancel your IPO application\nTap on IPO on the Home page\nClick on IPO orders & click on the IPO Order you wish to cancel\nTap on cancel & confirm to cancel your IPO Order\nHow can I check my IPO application status?\nFollow the below path to check your IPO application status\nTap on IPO on the Home page\nClick on IPO orders & click on the IPO Order for which you want to check the application status\nYour IPO application status will be visible from here\nWhere to check the IPO allotment status?\nFollow the below path to check your subscription status\nTap on IPO on the Home page\nClick on IPO orders & click on the IPO Order for which you want to check the subscription status\nYour IPO subscription status will be visible from here\nCan I submit multiple applications for an IPO?\nOnly 1 application per PAN is recommended. Even if you apply via different platforms using the same PAN, your application will be rejected and you will not get the IPO allotment. However, you can increase the chances of IPO allotment by applying with different account linked to different PAN.

Will ECS bounce charges be levied?\nYes, if you miss an EMI, a bounce charge of INR 450 will be applied.\nDo I get email/SMS reminders from the Banks before my EMI date?\nLenders will send EMI reminders before the due date via call and WhatsApp.\nDo I have the option of part prepayment of the loan? Are there any charges for it?\nNo, part prepayment of the loan is not available currently.\nHow do I check my payment statement online?\nYou can check your payment statement online under the ‘Loans’ tab. All details for verification, tracking, and managing your loans will be available there once the loan is approved.\nWhat happens if I don't pay back OR miss EMI repayments on the Loan?\nIf you miss or fail to repay your EMIs on the loan, it can negatively affect your credit score and may lead to additional charges or legal action. We strongly urge you to avoid missing your loan monthly installment payments.\nHow can I pay my missed EMI or foreclose the loan?\nIf your EMI is not cleared from your bank account via the auto debit E-NACH mandate on the due date due to inadvertent circumstances, you can pay it yourself through the Angel One app. Follow these steps:\nOpen the Angel One app.\nNavigate to the loan pass book.\nUse the “Pay Now” section to make the payment via net banking or debit card.\nAlternatively, the EMI mandate will be represented for auto debit from your bank account.\nTo foreclose the loan, you can also use the Angel One app to find the option to foreclose and complete the payment using the same methods.\nHow can I change my bank account used for repaying the EMI?\nPresently, we do not have the feature to facilitate the change of the bank account used to set up the EMI mandate. We urge you to continue servicing your EMI through the bank account that was used at the time of loan disbursement.\nWhen can I foreclose my loan?\nYour eligibility for foreclosure varies depending on the lender partner. Please check your loan documents for specific details regarding foreclosure eligibility and conditions.\nStill need help?\nCreate Ticket\nWant to connect with us?\nOur experts will be happy to assist you\nConnect with us\nStill have any queries?

Entire amount will be debited to your source bank account in 4-6 working days.\nWill my SIP get created if my order is in Failed state?\nNo, Your SIP will only be created when we received confirmation of successful payment from your bank account.\nIf payment fails, Your SIP payment will not be registered.\nI got less money than what I placed an withdrawal order for?\nYour withdraw amount is converted to corresponding units while placing order at exchange. We calculate the units to be withdrawn based on current NAVs.\nMutual fund NAVs (Net Asset Value) are updated every day after the market closes from Monday to Friday (All working days)\nFor example, on June 3rd, you will see the NAV for June 2nd.\nConsider the following scenario for withdraw order placed on June 3rd:\nIf NAV on 3rd June > 2nd June, You will receive an amount greater than order amount.\nIf NAV on 3rd June < 2nd June, You will receive an amount lesser than order amount.\nIn Summary, you will receive an amount according to latest NAV.\nWill my next instalment be auto-debited?\nYour next SIP instalment will be Auto-Debited from your bank account if you have a valid Auto-pay setup.\nIf not please setup an Autopay so that your future SIP instalments can be automated.\nTo setup an Autopay, Please click below:\n{Setup Autopay}\nWhat is Stamp duty?\nThe government collects 0.005% of the overall purchase amount of any mutual fund scheme as stamp duty.\nSo even if entire amount is debited from your bank account, 0.005 percent of total amount is deducted and hence when order is completed, Same is reflected as invested amount.\nStill need help?\nCreate Ticket\nWant to connect with us?\nOur experts will be happy to assist you\nConnect with us\nStill have any queries?

When the shares are credited to your account, the quantity of shares increases while the invested value remains unaffected. As a result, the average price of the stock reduces.
